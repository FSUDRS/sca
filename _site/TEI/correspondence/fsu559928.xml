         <opener><salute>Dear Ogilvie,</salute></opener>
         <p>Friends of mine in the Faculty of Law at Cambridge tell me that they are in touch with
            the British Council in the matter of a request for an increase in financial help for the
            purpose of financing a projected “Catalogue and History of English Criminal
            Legislation”. As I have seen <orig>someting</orig> of those who are
               <orig>easponsible</orig> for the Department of Criminal Science at Cambridge in
            connection with another matter that I shall mention, and as I know Dr. Radzinowicz, who
            is in charge of the project, may I send you a few words upon the
            <orig>metter</orig>?</p>
         <p>As you probably know, Comparative Law, which is a short title for the Comparative Study
            of Law, is a <orig>mewcomer</orig> in England and is only just beginning to receive
            serious attention. There is a part-time Chair in the University of London, the Quain
            Chair of Comparitive Law, and until twelve months ago Professer Gutteridge of Cambridge
            held a purely personal Chair in Comparative Law. There is also a journal of Comparative
            Law of long standing. On the other hand, in many foreign European countries this subject
            has for a long time received serious attention, and English lawyers have frequently been
            surprised by the keen interest shown by foreign lawyers in our legal institutions and by
            their knowledge of them. One practical application of this branch of legal study
            consists of the movement for the Unification of Private law for which purpose the
            British Government has participated in a number of international conferences in the last
            two decades.</p>
         <p>I know Dr Radzinowics and have read some of his preliminary explorations of the field
            which he now proposes to investigate, and I have been well impressed by the patient and
            deliberate manner in which he has matured his plans and the obviously
               <orig>exhanstive</orig> character of the undertaking which he proposes. It is clear
            that he is not anxious to get quick results, but has marked out a <orig>programme</orig>
            which will occupy the best years of his life, and may be expected to result in a
            scholarly production. I have every reason to think that his work, when completed, will
            bring substantial credit to this country by facilitating the study of our criminal
            system by foreign lawyers and penologists, and will also fill what is at present a
            serious gap in the history of our legal institutions. </p>
         <p>The other matter to which I <orig>regerred</orig> is an organization connected with the
            Department of Criminal Science at Cambridge and in which Dr Radzinowicz takes a
            prominent part, that is, the International Commission for Penal Reconstruction and
            Development, and it is in this connection that I first met him. One of its recent
            activities has been the consideration of the means of punishing War Criminals, and the
            Committee established for that purpose, of which I was Chairman, comprised unofficial
            representatives of all the United Nations except Russia and <orig>Chine</orig> - they
            were unofficial but in fact most of them were officials of their respective Governments.
            I felt at the time that this contact between the lawyers of the United Nations was a
            valuable one from a general political point of view because the legal exiles in this
            country were very keen upon tackling this problem, and the International Commission
            referred was able to supply that machinery and bring us all into close contact. I merely
            mention this as one of the cultural international by-products of the Department of
            Criminal Science at Cambridge with which Dr Radzinowicz is so closely identified.</p>
         <p>I know that the British Council has a strong Law Advisory Committee who will be able to
            express an expert opinion on this matter, but as I have had this recent contact with Dr
            Radzinowicz and his Cambridge friends I felt that I might venture to convey my
            impressions to you.</p>
         <closer>Yours Sincerely
         <signed>ARNOLD D. McNAIR</signed>
