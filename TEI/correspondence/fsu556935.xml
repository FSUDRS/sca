            <salute>Dear Dr. Liang,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>At the meeting of the International Commission held in London on July 29th last it was resolved to initiate an investigation into the methods of criminal administration established by the Axis countries, in countries and districts which they are occupying. The main purpose of this is to draw attention to dangerous principles upon which the Axis Governments have been acting in order that Allied Governments may have at their disposal the fullest legal information when they are taking their decisions concerning the organization of the administration of criminal justice after the war.</p>
         <p>It would be of very great value to the Commission in this task if they could be provided with some reports which would give information on the system of the criminal administration that Germany has imposed in the occupied districts of China, and we shall therefore be very grateful if, through your good offices, this could be arranged. </p>
         <closer>Yours Sincerely,  
               <dateline>
