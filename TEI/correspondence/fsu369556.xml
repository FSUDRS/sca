            <salute>Dear Madam</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>Your letter of the 24th Aust. Requesting the return of the genealogy given me by Mr.
            John A Pearce has been received.</p>
         <p>I have two copies of the geneaogy, and herewith return them both. I have not been able
            to find anything tangible in the case, and have not been to <unclear cert="low">Europe</unclear> since I saw you in Tallahassee, I have had some correspondence, but
            have learned nothing by them.</p>
         <p>I was in Tallahassee in May last, but did not have time to go into the <unclear
               cert="medium">country</unclear>, I went on Saturday and returned on Monday, and did
            not converse with any of the parties about the estate matter. Hoping that you may find
            these papers to be what you want, and that I may at some future time see you and Mr.
            Eppes at your Home. </p>
         <closer>I am
            <lb/>Yours Respectfully
            <signed>Angus Paterson </signed>
